On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid.

This is a calculator replica from the iphone 6 calculator. Includes:
indicators of key pressed
used only for single operations
the clear button, percent, and negative/positive switch operations all work
it works so that if you click on two different operations one right after the other, the calculator will take the most latest button clicked
there will only be one decimal per number typed
the first digit of the number will not be zero

It went suprisingly well, I didn't have as much difficulty as I normally do with largery projects. What was especially challenging was
putting in PEMDAS, but I decided that I wanted my calculator to only operate with single operations. It was also really
difficult to have the size of the number to decrease if the number went beyond the width of the phone. Sonali and I tried to come
up with a solution but after alot of online research and different trials, it just didn't work out. I'm proud that it is fully functioning
and that I could actually use this calculator. What was really helpful was to hear about all the little details of the calculator. For example,
I thought that if the calculator just performs the math operation, then it works, but I needed to make sure that there is only one decimal per number
and if the user types in multiple operations, one after the other, that it still works. But overall it was really fun, and I'm gald we
created something as useful as a calculator.
